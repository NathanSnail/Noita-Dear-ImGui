# Noita Dear ImGui bindings

## How to use this mod in your own mod?

This is a mod that needs to be installed on its own. It requires unsafe mode.
Any mod below it in the mod load order can then use the ImGui bindings that are
introduced by this mod. (Other mods do not need to enable unsafe mode!)

There's not really any documentation on how to use these bindings. I suggest you
use the [ImGui demo/example file](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/9aae45eb4a05a5a1f96be1ef37eb503a12ceb889/imgui_demo.cpp)
to search for functions/widgets that look useful to you and then check out the
source code of the bindings to see how to use it from Lua.

Also check out the ImGui FAQ: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md a lot of stuff there also applies to these bindings.

The bindings are a relatively close 1:1 mapping of the normal ImGui functions
except:

- References are used in ImGui to pass data in and alter it. Lua doesn't have
  references so this is turned into by-value arguments and additional return
  values.

- Most structures are broken up into individual elements. So instead of a
  `ImVec2 size` argument, these bindings will accept two arguments `size_x`,
  `size_y`.

- ImGui's `Begin`/`BeginChild` functions have an inconsistency that's explained
  [here](https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/blob/037d4a8bad1fc976f8dd731067fdc312a986f747/src/lua_features/imgui_windows.cpp#L6-L12).
  This inconsistency is already fixed in the bindings.

- Enums don't have the `ImGui` prefix since you already have to use them through
  the `imgui` table.

This standard ImGui code:

```cpp
ImGui::ColorPicker3("Color", (float*)&color,
    ImGuiColorEditFlags_PickerHueWheel | ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoSidePreview | ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoAlpha);
```

turns into this with these Noita/Lua bindings:

```lua
_, r, g, b = imgui.ColorEdit3("Colour", r, g, b,
    bit.bor(imgui.ColorEditFlags.PickerHueWheel, imgui.ColorEditFlags.NoSidePreview, imgui.ColorEditFlags.NoAlpha))
```
