# Noita Dear ImGui bindings

## How to use this in your own mod?

You are not expected to bundle this mod with your own mod, you should instead
instruct people to install this themselves alongside your mod.

Any mod below this mod in the load order can use the ImGui bindings. This mod requires 'unsafe' mode,
but mods that use the ImGui bindings don't need unsafe mode themselves.

There's not really any documentation on how to use these bindings. I suggest you
use the [ImGui demo/example file](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/9aae45eb4a05a5a1f96be1ef37eb503a12ceb889/imgui_demo.cpp)
to search for functions/widgets that look useful to you and then check out the
source code of this mod to see how to use it from Lua.

Also check out the ImGui FAQ: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md
a lot of stuff there also applies to these bindings.

There's also an example mod that shows the basics: https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/blob/main/ExampleMod/init.lua

The bindings are a relatively close 1:1 mapping of the normal ImGui functions except:

- References are used in ImGui to pass data in and alter it. Lua doesn't have
  references so this is turned into by-value arguments and additional return
  values.

- Most structures are broken up into individual elements. So instead of a
  `ImVec2 size` argument, these bindings will accept two arguments `size_x`,
  `size_y`.

- ImGui's `Begin`/`BeginChild` functions have an inconsistency that's explained
  [here](https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Dear-ImGui/blob/037d4a8bad1fc976f8dd731067fdc312a986f747/src/lua_features/imgui_windows.cpp#L6-L12).
  This inconsistency is fixed in the bindings.

- Enums don't have the `ImGui` prefix since you already have to use them through
  the `imgui` table.

This standard ImGui code:

```cpp
ImGui::ColorEdit3("Color", (float*)&color,
    ImGuiColorEditFlags_PickerHueWheel | ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoSidePreview | ImGuiColorEditFlags_NoAlpha);
```

turns into this with these Noita/Lua bindings:

```lua
_, r, g, b = imgui.ColorEdit3("Colour", r, g, b,
    bit.bor(imgui.ColorEditFlags.PickerHueWheel, imgui.ColorEditFlags.NoSidePreview, imgui.ColorEditFlags.NoAlpha))
```
